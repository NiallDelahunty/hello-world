First repository,
Hi!

My Name is Niall Delahunty, I am a molecular biologist by training but interested in how tech can be used to solve research and translational problems in both an academic and industry context. I am using Github to work as a repository for any projects I work on, as well as a tool for potential collaborations as I explore the vast and exciting world of computers.
